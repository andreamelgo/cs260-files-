    <li>Several centuries ago in Holland, tulips were more valuable than gold.</li><br>
    <li>Broccoli is actually a flower.</li><br>
    <li>Some plants such as orchids do not need soil to grow-they get all of their nutrients from the air.</li> <br>
    <li>Some plants produce <strong>toxic substances</strong> that kill other plants around them-the sunflower is an example.</li> <br>

            <li>
                For example, the Venus fly trap has leaves covered by little hairs. When a bug lands on the hairs, the trap snaps shut and digestive juices digest the bug.
